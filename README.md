_rs-collector_ is a [Bosun](https://bosun.org) compatible collector for various services that are not covered by [scollector](https://bosun.org/scollector/), and that we use at [CenterDevice](https://www.centerdevice.de/en/).

**Attention**:  Please be advised, even though we have been running _rs-collector_ on our production systems successfully for months, this is not stable software.

## Collectors

1. [Galera](#galera) - Collects metrics about the cluster status and cluster sync performance of a MySQL Galera cluster.
1. [HasIpAddr](#hasipaddr) - Checks if a host has bound specific IPv4 addresses.
1. [JVM](#JVM) - Collects garbage collection statistics.

1. [rs-collector](#rs-collector) - Collects internal metrics for rs-collector.

See below for details about the collectors.

### Galera

The _Galera_ collector collects metrics about the cluster status and cluster sync performance of a MySQL Galera cluster. We use it to watch for cluster split brain and general degradation situations. There is a full list of all available metrics in [galera.rs](src/collectors/galera.rs), function `metadata`.

The Galera collector supports SSL transport encryption on Linux. See the example configuration for how to enable SSL.

#### Example Alarms

```
alert galera.cluster.state.uuid.no.consensus {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = avg:galera.wsrep.cluster.state.uuid{domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q=q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $a = avg($q)
  $f = first($q)
  $q_alert = ($a - $f) != 0
  crit = $q_alert
}

alert galera.cluster.state.not.primary {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = sum:galera.wsrep.cluster.status{host=wildcard(*),domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q = q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $t = t(last($q), "domain")
  $q_alert = sum($t)
  $primaryValue = 0
  crit = $q_alert != $primaryValue
}

alert galera.local.state.not.synced {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = zimsum:5m-avg:galera.wsrep.local.state{domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q = q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $q_alert = last($q)
  $syncedValue = 12
  crit = $q_alert != $syncedValue
}

alert galera.cluster.size.degraded {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = avg:galera.wsrep.cluster.size{domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q = q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $q_alert = last($q)
  $critValue = 3
  crit = $q_alert != $critValue
}
```


### HasIpAddr

The _HasIpAddr_ collector sends either 1 or 0, depending on whether a host has bound a specific IPv4 address or not, respectively. This is helpful in cases where hosts bind or release IPv4 addresses dynamically. For example, in a `keepalived` VRRP cluster it allows Bosun to check if, and on how many hosts a virtual, high available IP address is bound.

In our production clusters we have observed situations when none of the cluster members had bound the virtual IP address. This collector allows us to define an alarm for such cases.

#### Example Alarm

```
alert os.net.vrrp-vip-failed {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = sum:os.net.has_ipv4s{ipv4=wildcard(*)}

  $q_alert = sum(t(last(q("$metric", "5m", "")), "ipv4"))

  $expected = 1
  $critValue = $expected
  crit = $q_alert != $critValue
}
```

### JVM

The _JVM_ collector collects garbage collection statistics, i.&nbsp;e. those that `jstat -gc` reveals for each specified, running JVM. This collector has been tested with OpenJDK "7u51-2.4.6-1ubuntu4" and Oracle JDK "1.8.0_121". JVMs are identified by a regular expression that matches the class name or the command line arguments.

This collector only collects statistics for specified JVMs; cf. example configuration. It currently does not distinguish between multiple instances of the same identified JVM. 


### Megaraid

The _Megaraid_ collector collector disk drive statistics using the MegaCLI tool. It collects statistics like

* `hw.storage.drivestats.mediaerrors`: Number of media errors reported for the device by the RAID controller.
* `hw.storage.drivestats.othererrors`: Number of other errors reported for the device by the RAID controller.
* `hw.storage.drivestats.predfailerrors`: Number of errors that are considered critical by the RAID controller.
* `hw.storage.drivestats.smartflag`
* `hw.storage.drivestats.firmwarestate`
* `hw.storage.drivestats.predfaileventno`: Sequence number of the most recent recorded predictive failure event.


### Mongo

The _Mongo_ collector collects MongoDB connection, op counter, replicaset and cluster metrics. We use it to check for cluster split brain and general degradation situations. There is a full list of all available metrics in [mongo.rs](src/collectors/mongo.rs), function `metadata`.

For connection and op statistics, the following metrics are helpful:

* `mongo.connections.current` collects the number of incoming connections from clients to the database server . This number includes the current shell session. Consider the value of connections.available to add more context to this datum. The value will include all incoming connections including any shell connections or connections from other servers, such as replica set members or mongos instances.
* `mongo.connections.available` collects the number of unused incoming connections available. Consider this value in combination with the value of connections.current to understand the connection load on the database, and the UNIX ulimit Settings document for more information about system thresholds on available connections.
* `mongo.connections.totalCreated` counts of all incoming connections created to the server. This number includes connections that have since closed.
* `mongo.opcounters.insert` collects the total number of insert operations received since the mongod instance last started.
* `mongo.opcounters.query` collects the total number of queries received since the mongod instance last started.
* `mongo.opcounters.update` collects the total number of update operations received since the mongod instance last started.
* `mongo.opcounters.delete` collects the total number of delete operations since the mongod instance last started.
* `mongo.opcounters.getmore` collects the total number of “getmore” operations since the mongod instance last started. This counter can be high even if the query count is low. Secondary nodes send getMore operations as part of the replication process.
* `mongo.opcounters.command` collects the total number of commands issued to the database since the mongod instance last started. `mongo.opcounters.command` counts all commands except the write commands: insert, update, and delete.

For replicaset and cluster monitoring, the following two metrics are helpful:

* `mongo.replicasets.members.mystate` collects the "myState" variable from each replica set member. This allows to compute if that particular replica set is in a sane state.
* `mongo.replicasets.oplog_lag.[min,avg,max]` collects the min, avg, and max oplog replication lag between a replica set's primary and the corresponding secondaries. These values are measured only on the currently active primary.

#### Example Alarms

```
alert mongo.replicaset.state.unexpected {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default

  $metric = sum:mongo.replicasets.members.mystate{host=wildcard(*),replicaset=wildcard(*)}
  $q = q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $t = t(last($q), "replicaset")
  $q_alert = sum($t)
  $critValue = 5
  crit = $q_alert != $critValue
}
```

### Postfix

The _Postfix_ collector collects metrics about Postfix' queues. This is helpful to monitor how the queues fill and empty over time, as well as to see if the queues are emptied at all, in order to alarm when mail delivery stalls. There is a full list of all available metrics in [postfix.rs](src/collectors/postfix.rs), function `metadata`.

#### Example Alarms

```
alert postfix.mailqueue.deferred.too.long {
  template = ...
  critNotification = default
  warnNotification = default

  $metric = sum:5m-min:postfix.queues.deferred{domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q = q("$metric", "5m", "")
  $t = t(last($q), "domain")
  $q_alert = sum($t)
  warn = $q_alert
}

alert postfix.mailqueue.deferred.unchanged {
  template = ...
  warnNotification = default

  $period = 4h
  $metric = postfix.queues.deferred{domain=wildcard(*)}
  $q_min = q("min:$metric", "$period", "")
  $q_max = q("max:$metric", "$period", "")

  $min_queue_len = min($q_min)
  $max_queue_len = max($q_max)

  $q_alert = $min_queue_len > 0 && $max_queue_len == $min_queue_len
  warn = $q_alert
}
```

### rs-collector Internal Metrics
* `rs-collector.stats.rss` collects the resident set size (physical memory) in KB consumed by rs-collector; only supported on Linux.
* `rs-collector.stats.samples` collects the number of transmitted samples.
* `rs-collector.versio` collects the version 'x.y.z' of rs-collector as x * 1.000.0000 + y * 1000 + z.

These metrics can also be used to check the liveliness of rs-collector and as a heartbeat.
